# Breaking the Enigma Machine

During the summer between Junior and Senior year of college, I was privliedged to have the experience of interning at the National Cryptologic Museum at Ft. Meade in Maryland. Tucked away in a converted hotel beside the National Security Agency, the National Cryptologic Museum is a little known treasure of the many excellent museums in the region.

Even as a History Major, I had never heard about it's existence until mere months before applying for the internship.

I spent my time learning about the history of cryptology, providing guided tours, and assisting presentations that featured some of the museums assets
